# Number-guesser
This is a simple and fun Python-based number guessing game. The user is prompted to select a difficulty levelâ€”either *Easy* or *Hard*. 

- *Easy Mode:* You get *10 attempts* to guess the number.
- *Hard Mode:* You get only *5 attempts* to guess the number.

The game randomly selects a number between *1 and 100*. The user then tries to guess this number within the given attempts. If the guess matches the randomly chosen number, the user wins! Otherwise, the user keeps guessing until they either guess correctly or run out of attempts. If all attempts are used up without a correct guess, the game is over.
